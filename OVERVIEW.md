In this assignment, we focused on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using supervised learning models. We began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features. Following this, we performed feature engineering and data preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling.

We trained multiple machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes, and evaluated them using metrics like accuracy and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV was applied to optimize model performance.

Finally, we summarized our findings, highlighting the best-performing model and reflecting on the overall process and any challenges encountered. This assignment provided a hands-on experience with the supervised learning workflow.
